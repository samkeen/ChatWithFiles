# ChatWithFiles
A chat interface for interrogating uploaded files.

⚠️ NOTE: app will upload portions of the file's contents to the OpenAI API. Do not use with file contianing any personal or propritary information. I suggest using public documents like [Twitter's terms of service](https://cdn.cms-twdigitalassets.com/content/dam/legal-twitter/site-assets/2023-05-18/en/twitter-user-agreement_2023-05-18.pdf)
